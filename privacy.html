  <h1>CatClicker Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Effective date: 2025-12-17</p>

  <h2>1) Who we are</h2>
  <p>CatClicker is a mobile game published by Kayalar GameDev Studio ("we", "us").</p>

  <h2>2) What data we collect</h2>
  <p>Depending on your device and whether you use optional features (such as Google Play Games login), the app and integrated SDKs may collect and process:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>User identifiers</strong> (for example, platform player IDs used for sign-in, cloud save, and leaderboards)</li>
    <li><strong>Player name</strong> (only if you sign in with Google Play Games and the name is available)</li>
    <li><strong>Purchase information</strong> (for example, to validate and restore in-app purchases)</li>
    <li><strong>Approximate location</strong> (derived from IP address, typically used for ad delivery and measurement)</li>
    <li><strong>Device identifiers</strong> (such as advertising-related identifiers, used for ads and measurement)</li>
    <li><strong>App activity</strong> (such as ad interactions and basic in-app interactions)</li>
    <li><strong>Diagnostics</strong> (crash logs and performance data)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) How we use data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>App functionality</strong>: save and restore game progress, enable sign-in, leaderboards, and other online features</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising</strong>: show rewarded ads and measure ad performance</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics and diagnostics</strong>: improve stability and performance (for example, crash reporting)</li>
    <li><strong>Purchases</strong>: process, validate, and restore in-app purchases</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Third-party services</h2>
  <p>CatClicker may use third-party services that process data under their own privacy policies, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Play Games Services (sign-in, leaderboards)</li>
    <li>Google AdMob (rewarded ads, ad measurement)</li>
    <li>Google Play Billing (in-app purchases)</li>
    <li>Unity services (such as authentication and cloud save, if enabled)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) Data sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell personal data. Data may be shared with service providers only to operate the app features listed above (for example ads, sign-in, purchases, cloud save, diagnostics).</p>

  <h2>6) Data retention</h2>
  <p>We retain data only as long as needed to provide app functionality and comply with legal or platform requirements. Cloud-saved game data is typically retained until you request deletion.</p>

  <h2>7) Security</h2>
  <p>Data is transferred over encrypted connections (for example HTTPS/TLS) where supported by the services we use.</p>

  <h2>8) Children</h2>
  <p>If the app is directed to children or includes children in its target audience, we commit to follow the Google Play Families Policy and configure our ad and data practices accordingly.</p>

  <h2>9) Your choices and data deletion</h2>
